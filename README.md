# Pragmatic BPMN

This repository contains an implementation of elements of BPMN, and some usages of these elements.
I called it *pragmatic* since I will eventually (maybe) cover all the concepts defined in BPMN, but I will start small and simple with what I include.
Don't take anything for granted, or exactly how the specification wants it.
First of all, the implementation will offer the features needed to build general models.
Because most of the time, we just need simple process models and not all the types BPMN actually offers.

## Origin

Working with simulations, and in an SCM field, I constantly use BPMN because it's just a very simple way of defining and designing processes.
But somehow, there is no model available to have these models in code - at least not in .NET.
Thus, as a pet project, I just start with my own implementation and challenging myself to have good and usually stupid design ideas.

## Outlook

I hope to use my model for some cool transformation between tools.
Since my master's degree, I'm really interested in creating simulation models based on process definitions.
And I will try to offer an approach to support JaamSim and maybe even Simio.
Further, I'm thinking of supporting PlantUML and Camunda.
But let's see how far I will get and how good such integrations can work.

## Use at your own Risk

Feel free to fork my repo.
I will extend the code from time to time, when I have time or new ideas.
Chances are, with soooo many projects, that it will die sometime along the road =) 
Let's see how long I have my fun doing this.
